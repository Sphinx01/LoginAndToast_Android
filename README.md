# LoginAndToast_Android
This is a very simple and basic app developed on Android Studio. It has only one activity that enables a user to login in. 
When the user clicks on the button Sign In, a message is displayed as a toast: It displays an error if one of the fields is empty or dislays a welcoming message to the user.
